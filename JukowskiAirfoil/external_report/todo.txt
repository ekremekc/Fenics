Things to be done with the external report:
- Write the abstract.
- Proper title.
- Find references.
- Finish the analysis of convergence of the force on the circle. Do the same with the derivative of the force.
- Decide whether it is good to have so large pictures for flow fields. If they are on separate pages they could be even larger.
- Lager font size for Lift-Drag versus angle plot (file lift_drag.pdf).
- Proper title.
- Acknowledgements.
- Write about the eigenvalues. Large real values: real things. Small real values (large negative): numerical things.

- Possibly other things (header? etc.)
